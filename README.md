# Hotel Management System

This is a hotel reservation system where a user has the option of booking hotel rooms with different services at various locations. This system is built using MySQL-PHP for backend and HTML-CSS for frontend. The database also keeps track of the people who have checked in and checked out along with the date of reservation. Put all the files and images in the same folder or update the folder paths in the files accordingly.
